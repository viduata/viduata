viduata is a lousy programmer and a worse electrical engineer. I don't need you to tell me.

I'm interested in a lot of stuff, but mostly control systems in STM23 these days.

I'm currently learning how to optimize underpowered systems to pretend to have concurrency.

I'm not looking to collaborate on anything.
